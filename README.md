### What Is A Twiddler?

A Twiddler is a wearable one-handed chord keyboard. When strapped to one's palm, the fingers can access twelve buttons in a three by four grid. The thumb can reach four modifier keys: Num, Alt, Ctrl and Shift. You use combinations of these buttons to emulate a full-sized keyboard.

As there are 254 possible combinations of these buttons, there is scope for additional functionality. This is most typically used to produce multi character chords: where one combination of buttons produces more than one character of output.

### Why Do You Use One?

I picked up some tendon damage to my right hand in my 20's. I've had an interest in alternative input devices ever since.
